## How to Contribute

### Finding or Creating Issues

Anyone can open an issue for discussion. You can head to [official GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) for deeper understanding about GitHub Issues. After that, you can start finding SiPencari Issues in [our Issues section](https://github.com/imrenagi/sipencari/issues). There are two categories in this section, Open and Closed.

#### Open Issues

Open Issues are issues that need more attention and need to be resolved. Contributors might picked any open issues to be working on.

#### Closed Issues

Closed Issues are issues that have been completed or doesn't need further action. Closed issues can be reopened if contributors find any issues related to it sometime in the future.

#### For Beginners: `good first issue` label

As mentioned [here](https://github.blog/2020-01-22-browse-good-first-issues-to-start-contributing-to-open-source/), `good first issue` is a label from GitHub which created in order to help identify suitable issues for beginner contributors. `good first issue` informed us about the difficulty level of an issue.

But since all of the contributors here are *Anak Bangsa*, we can assume that all of the issues are easy to work on.
